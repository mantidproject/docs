Description
-----------

Clones the input :ref:`Matrix Workspaces <MatrixWorkspace>` and orders the
x-axis in an ascending or descending fashion. Ensures that the y-axis and error data as well as optional Dx data
are sorted in a consistent way with the x-axis.

This algorithm is for use with small workspaces loaded. It is
particularly suitable for reformatting workspaces loaded via
:ref:`LoadAscii <algm-LoadAscii>`. Input workspaces must be point data.
