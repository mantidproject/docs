A mantid session can be saved as a project for saving the work process (workspaces, histories, plots etc.).

Main menu -> View -> Project

A project view might look like:

.. figure:: /images/Training/WorkspacesAlgorithmsInterfaces/Project1.png
   :align: center

Main menu -> File -> New -> New Project

Main menu -> File -> Load -> Project

Main menu -> File -> Recent Projects

When closing MantidPlot while workspaces still exist (non empty project), you will see the follwing window:

.. figure:: /images/Training/WorkspacesAlgorithmsInterfaces/Project2.png
   :align: center
