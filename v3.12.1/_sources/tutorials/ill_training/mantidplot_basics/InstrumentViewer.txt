The instrument view consists of few tabs on the left, and the 3D view itself on the right.
The tabs offer some useful functionality as follows:

* Render: This allows to visualize the detector data mapped to the instrument pixels.
* Pick: This tab allows to mouse hover over a detector pixel to show the data it recorded.
* Draw: This enables drawing sample geometrical shapes for masking, integration, grouping, or choosing regions of interests.
* Instrument: This shows the hierarchical tree structure of the instrument components.

More detailed description of the functionality can be found `here <https://www.mantidproject.org/MantidPlot:_Instrument_View>`__.
