 Downloading and Installing
===========================

Downloading
-----------

To get started go to http://download.mantidproject.org/.

There are two download options:
 * **Latest release** - The latest stable release, with new releases made every 3 - 4 months. Use this for the most stable version of Mantid.
 * **Nighlty build** - Can be used to test out work in progress, it is less well tested but quicker for developers to make changes.

Installation
------------

Please follow instructions on download site according to operating system. For Windows and Mac there is an installer package, while for Ubuntu you can use :code:`apt-get`. For the new instrument computers Mantid 3.11 will be pre-installed, or the nightly will be installed if required.

ILL Example Data
----------------

You can download the ILL usage example data from this link - `ILL_Usage_Examples.zip <https://code.ill.fr/scientific-software/mantid-test-data/raw/master/ILL_Usage_Examples.zip>`__. To get access to this you will need to have logged into https://code.ill.fr/ and then request access from the CS group, if you have not been added already.

First Time Setup
----------------

Setting the default facility is important to help Mantid find the ILL data files correctly. You can also select a preferred instrument, but in most cases this will not affect the behaviour of Mantid.
