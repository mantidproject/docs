Crystal Field Python Interface
==============================

  :local:

The python facilities for Crystal Field calculations are available in Mantid from module `CrystalField`.
There are two main classes the module provides: `CrystalFiled` that defines various properties of a crystal
field and `CrystalFieldFit` that manages the fitting process.


Setting up crystal field parameters
-----------------------------------

A crystal field computation starts with creating an instance of the `CrystalField` class. The constructor
has two mandatory arguments: `Ion` - a symbolic name of the ion, and `Symmetry` - a name of the symmetry group
of the field. The rest of the parameters are optional.

Possible values for the `Ion` argument::

 Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb
 
Allowed values for `Symmetry`::

  C1, Ci, C2, Cs, C2h, C2v, D2, D2h, C4, S4, C4h, D4, C4v, D2d, D4h, C3,
  S6, D3, C3v, D3d, C6, C3h, C6h, D6, C6v, D3h, D6h, T, Td, Th, O, Oh
  
The minimum code to create a crystal field object is::

  from CrystalField import CrystalField
  cf = CrystalField('Ce', 'C2v')
  
Names of the crystal field parameters have the form `Bnn` and `IBnn` where `nn` are two digits between 0 and 6.
The `Bnn` is a real and the `IBnn` is an imaginary part of a complex parameter. If a parameter isn't set explicitly
its default value is 0. To set a parameter pass it to the `CrystalField` constructor as a keyword argument, e.g.::

  cf = CrystalField('Ce', 'C2v', B20=0.37737, B22=3.9770)

An alternative way to set a parameter is to use the square brackets with a `CrystalField` object::

  cf['B40'] = -0.031
  
Which can also be used to query the value of a parameter::

  b = cf['B40']


Calculating the Eigensystem
---------------------------

`CrystalFiled` class has methods to calculate the Hamiltonian and its eigensystem::

  # Calculate and return the Hamiltonian matrix as a 2D numpy array.
  h = cf.getHamiltonian()
  
  # Calculate and return the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian as a 1D numpy array.
  e = cf.getEigenvalues()
  
  # Calculate and return the eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian as a 2D numpy array.
  w = cf.getEigenvectors()

It is efficient to call the above methods multiple times as all the outputs are cached and the calculations are repeated
only after a parameter changes.


Calculating a Spectrum
----------------------

To calculate a spectrum `CrystalField` needs to know the sample temperature and the shape of the peaks.

The temperature can be set either via a keyword argument `Temperature` of the constructor or using the
`Temperature` property::

  # Using the keyword argument
  cf = CrystalField('Ce', 'C2v', B20=0.37737, B22=3.9770, Temperature=44)
  
  # Using the property
  cf.Temperature = 44

Knowing the temperature allows us to calculate a peak list: a list of transition energies and intensities.::

  print cf.getPeakList()
  
The output is::

 [[  0.00000000e+00   2.44006198e+01   4.24977124e+01   1.80970926e+01 -2.44006198e+01]
  [  2.16711565e+02   8.83098530e+01   5.04430056e+00   1.71153708e-01  1.41609425e-01]]

The first row are the energies (in meV) and the second row are the integrated intensities (in milibarn per steradian).

The number of peaks that the function returns is controlled by two tolerance parameters: `ToleranceEnergy` and
`ToleranceIntensity`. If a peak has an intensity below the value of `ToleranceIntensity` the peak is ignored.
It two peaks have a difference in the energies smaller than `ToleranceEnergy` they are combined into a single peak.

If we set `ToleranceIntensity` of the above crystal field object to 1 mb/sr we'll have only three peaks in the list::

  cf.ToleranceIntensity = 1
  print cf.getPeakList()
  
The new output::

 [[   0.           24.40061976   42.49771237]
  [ 216.71156467   88.30985303    5.04430056]]
  
To calculate a spectrum we need to define a shape of each peak (peak profile function) and its default width (`FWHM`).
The width can be set either via a keyword argument or a property with name `FWHM`. If the peak shape isn't set the default
of Lorentzian is assumed. To set a different shape use the `setPeaks` method::

  cf.setPeaks('Gaussian')
  cf.FWHM = 0.9
  
The arguments of `setPeaks` are expected to be names of Mantid peak fit functions. At the moment only `Lorentzian` and
`Gaussian` can be used.

After the peak shape is defined a spectrum can be calculated::

  sp = cf.getSpectrum()
  
The output is a tuple of two 1d numpy arrays (x, y) that can be used with `matplotlib` to plot::

  pyplot.plot(*sp)
  pyplot.show()
  
.. image:: /images/CrystalFieldSpectrum1.png
   :height: 300
   
It is possible to change parameters of individual peaks separately. Note though that only the shape parameters can be changed,
the peak centre and the integrated intensity are defined by the crystal field parameters. To change the width of a peak
use the following syntax::

  # If the peak shape is Gaussian
  cf.peaks.param[1]['Sigma'] = 2.0
  cf.peaks.param[2]['Sigma'] = 0.01

  # If the peak shape is Lorentzian
  cf.peaks.param[1]['FWHM'] = 2.0
  cf.peaks.param[2]['FWHM'] = 0.01
  
The three peaks now have all different widths. The first peak (index 0) keeps the default value.

.. image:: /images/CrystalFieldSpectrum2.png
   :height: 300

If called without arguments `getSpectrum()` determines automatically the range and number of the `x`-points. To have more control
of how the spectrum is calculated a list (or numpy array) of x-values can be provided as a first argument to `getSpectrum`.
Alternatively, the x-values can be taken from a workspace::

  # Use a list for x-values
  x = [0, 1, 2, 3, ...]
  sp = cf.getSpectrum(x)
  
  # Use the first spectrum of a workspace
  sp = cf.getSpectrum(ws)
  
  # Use the i-th spectrum of a workspace
  sp = cf.getSpectrum(ws, i)
   

Plotting in MantidPlot
----------------------

To plot a spectrum using MantidPlot's graphing facilities `CrystalField` has method `plot`. It has the same arguments as `getSpectrum`
and opens a window with a plot.


Adding a Background
-------------------

A background has two components: a peak and a general background function. Set a background using the `background` property::

    from CrystalField import CrystalField, CrystalFieldFit, Background, Function
    cf = CrystalField('Ce', 'C2v', B20=0.37737, B22=3.9770, B40=-0.031787, B42=-0.11611, B44=-0.12544,
                      Temperature=44.0, FWHM=1.1)
    cf.background = Background(peak=Function('Gaussian', Height=10, Sigma=1),
                               background=Function('LinearBackground', A0=1.0, A1=0.01))
    
Here is an example of how to access the parameters of the background::
    
    h = cf.background.peak.param['Height']
    a1 = cf.background.background.param['A1']
    
    
Setting Ties and Constraints
----------------------------

Setting ties and constraints are done by calling the `ties` and `constraints` methods of the `CrystalField` class or its components.
To `Bnn` parameters are tied by the `CrystalField` class directly specifying the tied parameter as a keyword argument::

  cf.ties(B20=1.0, B40='B20/2')
  
The constraints are passed as strings containing expressions::

  cf.constraints('1 < B22 <= 2', 'B22 < 4')
  
For the parameters of the background the syntax is the same but the methods are called on the `background` property::

    cf.background.peak.ties(Height=10.1)
    cf.background.peak.constraints('Sigma > 0')
    cf.background.background.ties(A0=0.1)
    cf.background.background.constraints('A1 > 0')
    
The names of the peak parameters both in ties and constraints must include the index of the peak to which they belong. Here we follow
the naming convention of the :ref:`func-CompositeFunction`: f<n>.<name>, where <n> stands for an integer index staring at 0 and <name>
is the name of the parameter. For example, `f1.Sigma`, `f3.FWHM`. Because names now contain the period symbol '.' keyword arguments
cannot be used. Instead we must pass strings containing ties::

    cf.peaks.ties('f2.FWHM=2*f1.FWHM', 'f3.FWHM=2*f2.FWHM')
    
and constraints are also a list of strings::

    cf.peaks.constraints('f0.FWHM < 2.2', 'f1.FWHM >= 0.1')
    
If a parameter of all peaks needs to be tied/constrained with the same expression then the following shortcut methods can be used::

    cf.peaks.tieAll('Sigma=0.1', 3)
    cf.peaks.constrainAll('0 < Sigma < 0.1', 4)

where the first argument is the general formula of the tie/constraint and the second is the number of peaks to apply to.
The is also a version for a range of peak indices::

    cf.peaks.tieAll('Sigma=f0.Sigma', 1, 3)

which is equivalent to::

    cf.peaks.ties('f1.Sigma=f0.Sigma', 'f2.Sigma=f0.Sigma', 'f3.Sigma=f0.Sigma')


Setting Resolution Model
------------------------

Resolution model here is a way to constrain widths of the peaks to realistic numbers which agree with a measured or
calculated instrument resolution function. A model is a function that returns a FWHM for a peak centre. The Crystal
Field python interface defines helper class `ResolutionModel` to help define and set resolution models.

To construct an instance of `ResolutionModel` one needs to provide up to four input parameters. The first parameter, `model`, is
mandatory and can be either of the two

1. A tuple containing two arrays (lists) of real numbers which will be interpreted as tabulated values of the model function. The first element of the tuple is a list of increasing values for peak centres, and the second element is a list of corresponding widths. Values between the tabulated peak positions will be linearly interpolated.

2. A python function that takes a numpy array of peak positions and returns a numpy array of widths.

If the model is a tuple of two arrays then no additional parameters are required. If it's a function then the rest of the parameters define how to tabulate this
function. `xstart` and `xend` define the interval of interpolation which must include all fitted peaks. The last argument is `accuracy` that defaults to
:math:`10^{-4}` and defines an approximate desired accuracy of the approximation. The interval will be split until the largest error of the interpolation
is smaller than `accuracy`. Note that subdivision cannot go on to infinity as the number of points is limited by the class member `ResolutionModel.max_model_size`.

Example of setting a resolution model::

    rm = ResolutionModel(([1, 2, 3, ...., 100], [0.1, 0.3, 0.35, ..., 2.1]))
    cf = CrystalField('Ce', 'C2v', B20=0.37737, B22=3.9770, ..., Temperature=44.0, ResolutionModel=rm)

    ...

    rm = ResolutionModel(my_func, xstart=0.0, xend=120.0, accuracy=0.01)
    cf = CrystalField('Ce', 'C2v', B20=0.37737, B22=3.9770, ..., Temperature=44.0, ResolutionModel=rm)

When a resolution model is set the peak width will be constrained to have a value close to the model. The degree of deviation is controlled by the
`FWHMVariation` parameter. It has the default of 0.1 and is an absolute maximum difference a width can have. If set to 0 the widths will be fixed
to their calculated values (depending on the instant values of their peak centres). For example::

    cf = CrystalField('Ce', 'C2v', B20=0.37737, B22=3.9770, ..., Temperature=44.0, ResolutionModel=rm, FWHMVariation=0.001)



Defining Multiple Spectra
-------------------------

A `CrystalField` object can be configured to work with multiple spectra. In this case some many of the object's properties
become lists. Here is an example of defining a `CrystalField` object with two spectra::

    cf = CrystalField('Ce', 'C2v', B20=0.37737, B22=3.9770, B40=-0.031787, B42=-0.11611, B44=-0.12544,
                      Temperature=[44.0, 50], FWHM=[1.1, 0.9])
    cf.setPeaks('Lorentzian')
    cf.peaks[0].param[0]['FWHM'] = 1.11
    cf.peaks[1].param[1]['FWHM'] = 1.12
    cf.setBackground(peak=Function('Gaussian', Height=10, Sigma=0.3),
                     background=Function('FlatBackground', A0=1.0))
    cf.background[1].peak.param['Sigma'] = 0.8
    cf.background[1].background.param['A0'] = 1.1

Note how `Temperature`, `FWHM`, `peaks` and `background` become lists. They must have the same size. Ties and constraints similarly
change::

    # The B parameters are common for all spectra - syntax doesn't change
    cf.ties(B20=1.0, B40='B20/2')
    cf.constraints('1 < B22 <= 2', 'B22 < 4')

    # Backgrounds and peaks are different for different spectra - must be indexed
    cf.background[0].peak.ties(Height=10.1)
    cf.background[0].peak.constraints('Sigma > 0.1')
    cf.background[1].peak.ties(Height=20.2)
    cf.background[1].peak.constraints('Sigma > 0.2')
    cf.peaks[1].tieAll('FWHM=2*f1.FWHM', 2, 5)
    cf.peaks[0].constrainAll('FWHM < 2.2', 1, 6)

The resolution model also needs to be initialised from a list::

    x0, y0, x1, y1 = [ ... ], [ ... ], [ ... ], [ ... ]
    rm = ResolutionModel([(x0, y0), (x1, y1)])

    # or

    rm = ResolutionModel([func0, func1], 0, 100, accuracy = 0.01)


To calculate a spectrum call the same method `getSpectrum` but pass the spectrum index as its first parameter::

  # Calculate second spectrum, use the generated x-values
  sp = cf.getSpectrum(1)

  # Calculate third spectrum, use a list for x-values
  x = [0, 1, 2, 3, ...]
  sp = cf.getSpectrum(2, x)
  
  # Calculate second spectrum, use the first spectrum of a workspace
  sp = cf.getSpectrum(1, ws)
  
  # Calculate first spectrum, use the i-th spectrum of a workspace
  sp = cf.getSpectrum(0, ws, i)


Multiple Ions
-------------

If there are multiple ions define `CrystalField` objects for each ion separately then add them together::

    params = {'B20': 0.377, 'B22': 3.9, 'B40': -0.03, 'B42': -0.116, 'B44': -0.125,
              'Temperature': [44.0, 50], 'FWHM': [1.1, 0.9]}
    cf1 = CrystalField('Ce', 'C2v', **params)
    cf2 = CrystalField('Pr', 'C2v', **params)
    cf = cf1 + cf2

The expression that combines the `CrystalField` objects also defines the contributions of each site into the overall intensity.
The higher the coefficient of the object in the expression the higher its relative contribution. For example::

    cf = 2*cf1 + cf2

means that the intensity of `cf1` should be twice that of `cf2`.

Fitting
-------

To fit the crystal field and peak parameters first create a `CrystalField` object as described above. Then create an
instance (object) of the `CrystalFieldFit` class::

    from CrystalField import CrystalFieldFit
    # In case of a single spectrum (ws is a workspace)
    fit = CrystalFieldFit(Model=cf, InputWorkspace=ws)
    
    # Or for multiple spectra
    fit = CrystalFieldFit(Model=cf, InputWorkspace=[ws1, ws2])
    
Then call `fit()` method::

    fit.fit()
    
After fitting finishes the `CrystalField` object updates automatically and contains new fitted parameter values.

Finding Initial Parameters
--------------------------

If the initial values of the fitting parameters are not known they can be estimated using `estimate_parameters()` method.
It randomly searches the parameter space in a given region such that the calculated spectra are as close to the
fit data as possible. The method uses :ref:`EstimateFitParameters <algm-EstimateFitParameters>` internally. See
algorithm's description for the available properties.
Here is an example of a fit with initial estimation::

    from CrystalField.fitting import makeWorkspace
    from CrystalField import CrystalField, CrystalFieldFit, Background, Function

    # Create some crystal field data
    origin = CrystalField('Ce', 'C2v', B20=0.37737, B22=3.9770, B40=-0.031787, B42=-0.11611, B44=-0.12544,
                          Temperature=44.0, FWHM=1.1)
    x, y = origin.getSpectrum()
    ws = makeWorkspace(x, y)

    # Define a CrystalField object with parameters slightly shifted.
    cf = CrystalField('Ce', 'C2v', B20=0, B22=0, B40=0, B42=0, B44=0,
                      Temperature=44.0, FWHM=1.0, ResolutionModel=([0, 100], [1, 1]), FWHMVariation=0)

    # Set any ties on the field parameters.
    cf.ties(B20=0.37737)
    # Create a fit object
    fit = CrystalFieldFit(cf, InputWorkspace=ws)
    # Find initial values for the field parameters.
    # You need to define the energy splitting and names of parameters to estimate.
    # Optionally additional constraints can be set on tied parameters (eg, peak centres).
    fit.estimate_parameters(EnergySplitting=50,
                            Parameters=['B22', 'B40', 'B42', 'B44'],
                            Constraints='20<f1.PeakCentre<45,20<f2.PeakCentre<45',
                            NSamples=1000)
    print 'Returned', fit.get_number_estimates(), 'sets of parameters.'
    # The first set (the smallest chi squared) is selected by default.
    # Select a different parameter set if required
    fit.select_estimated_parameters(3)
    print cf['B22'], cf['B40'], cf['B42'], cf['B44']
    # Run fit
    fit.fit()

Calculating Physical Properties
-------------------------------

In addition to the inelastic neutron spectrum, various physical properties arising from the crystal field interaction
can be calculated. These include the crystal field contribution to the magnetic heat capacity, the magnetic 
susceptibility, and magnetisation. The calculated values can be invoked using the `getHeatCapacity()`, 
`getSusceptibility()` and `getMagneticMoment()` methods. 

To calculate the heat capacity use::

    Cv = cf.getHeatCapacity()       # Calculates Cv(T) for 1<T<300K in 1K steps  (default)
    pyplot.plot(*Cv)                # Returns a tuple of (x, y) values

    T = np.arange(1,900,5)
    Cv = cf.getHeatCapacity(T)      # Calculates Cv(T) for specified values of T (1 to 900K in 5K steps here)
    pyplot.plot(T, Cv[1])

    # Temperatures from a single spectrum workspace
    ws = CreateWorkspace(T, T, T)
    Cv = cf.getHeatCapacity(ws)     # Use the x-values of a workspace as the temperatures
    ws_calc = CreateWorkspace(*Cv)
    plot(ws_calc, 0)                # Creates workspace from data and plots it (plots the first spectrum, index 0)

    # Temperatures from a multi-spectrum workspace
    ws = CreateWorkspace(T, T, T, NSpec=2)
    Cv = cf.getHeatCapacity(ws, 1)  # Uses the second spectrum's x-values for T (e.g. 450<T<900)
    plot(*Cv)

All the physical properties methods returns a tuple of `(x, y)` values. The heat capacity is calculated in 
Jmol\ :sup:`-1`\ K\ :sup:`-1`\ .
The theory is described in :ref:`CrystalFieldHeatCapacity <func-CrystalFieldHeatCapacity>`.

The molar susceptibility is calculated using Van Vleck's formula, and requires in addition knowledge of the applied 
field direction (default is `[0, 0, 1]` where the field is along the crystal field quantisation direction)::

    chi_v = cf.getSusceptibility(T, Hdir=[1, 1, 1])

The field direction is a Cartesian vector with coordinates defined with the `z`-axis parallel to the quantisation
direction of the crystal field parameters (usually taken to be the highest symmetry rotation axis). To calculate
for a powder averaged field direction use::

    chi_v_powder = cf.getSusceptibility(T, Hdir='powder')

The powder averaging is done by taking the mean of the susceptibility (or magnetisation) along the :math:`x`,
:math:`y` and :math:`z` directions (e.g. :math:`\chi^{\mathrm{pow}} = (\chi^x + \chi^y + \chi^z)/3`).

Note that the function calculates the *molar* magnetic susceptibility, and by default outputs it in *cgs* units
(cm\ :sup:`3`/mol or emu/mol). To obtain the result in SI units (m\ :sup:`3`/mol)
use::

    chi_v_cgs = cf.getSusceptibility(T, Hdir=[1, 1, 0], Unit='SI')

In addition, "atomic" units (:math:`\mu_B/\mathrm{T}/\mathrm{ion}`) can also be obtained using::

    chi_v_bohr = cf.getSusceptibility(T, Unit='bohr')

The theory is described in the :ref:`CrystalFieldSusceptibility <func-CrystalFieldSusceptibility>` function page.

The magnetic moment is calculated by adding a Zeeman interaction to the crystal field Hamiltonian and diagonalising 
the combined matrix, from which the expectation of the magnetic moment operator is calculated. The moment can
be calculated as a function of temperature or applied field magnitude::

    moment_t = cf.getMagneticMoment(Temperature=T, Hdir=[1, 1, 1], Hmag=0.1) # Calcs M(T) with at 0.1T field||[111]
    H = np.linspace(0, 30, 121)
    moment_h = cf.getMagneticMoment(Hmag=H, Hdir='powder', Temperature=10)   # Calcs M(H) at 10K for powder sample

By default, the magnetisation is calculated in atomic units of bohr magnetons per magnetic ion. Alternatively, the 
SI or cgs molar magnetic moments can be calculated::

    moment_SI = cf.getMagneticMoment(H, [1, 1, 1], Unit='SI')         # M(H) in Am^2/mol at 1K for H||[111]
    moment_cgs = cf.getMagneticMoment(100, Temperature=T, Unit='cgs') # M(T) in emu/mol in a field of 100G || [001]

Please note that if cgs units are used, then the magnetic field must be specified in *Gauss* rather than *Tesla*
(1T == 10000G). Note also that the cgs unit "emu/mol" in this case is "erg/Gauss/mol" quantifying a molar magnetic
moment. 

Finally, please note that the calculation result is the molar magnetic moment. Thus to get the magnetisation, you
should divide this by the molar volume of the material. 
By default, the calculation temperature is 1K, and the applied magnetic field is 1T along [001]. For further details 
and a description of the theory, see the :ref:`CrystalFieldMagnetisation <func-CrystalFieldMagnetisation>` and 
:ref:`CrystalFieldMoment <func-CrystalFieldMoment>` pages.

Fitting Physical Properties
---------------------------

Instead of fitting the inelastic neutron spectrum, the physical properties can be fitted using a similar interface
to that described above. The main difference is that some experimental setup information has to be given - especially
for the susceptibility and magnetisation. This is done by specifying an instance of the `PhysicalProperties` helper
class as the `PhysicalProperty` attribute of `CrystalField`, either as a keyword argument in the constructor::

    from CrystalField import CrystalField, CrystalFieldFit, PhysicalProperties
    # Fits a heat capacity dataset - you must have subtracted the phonon contribution by some method already
    # and the data must be in J/mol/K.
    cf = CrystalField('Ce', 'C2v', B20=0.37737, B22=3.9770, B40=-0.031787, B42=-0.11611, B44=-0.12544,
                      PhysicalProperty=PhysicalProperties('Cv'))
    fitcv = CrystalFieldFit(Model=cf, InputWorkspace=ws)
    fitcv.fit()

or separately after construction::

    cf = CrystalField('Ce', 'C2v', B20=0.37737, B22=3.9770, B40=-0.031787, B42=-0.11611, B44=-0.12544)
    cf.PhysicalProperty = PhysicalProperties('Cv')
    fitcv = CrystalFieldFit(Model=cf, InputWorkspace=ws)
    fitcv.fit()

    # Fits a susceptibility dataset. Data is the volume susceptibility in SI units
    cf.PhysicalProperty = PhysicalProperties('susc', Hdir='powder', Unit='SI')
    fit_chi = CrystalFieldFit(Model=cf, InputWorkspace=ws)
    fit_chi.fit()

    # Fits a magnetisation dataset. Data is in emu/mol, and was measured at 5K with the field || [111].
    cf.PhysicalProperty = PhysicalProperties('M(H)', Temperature=5, Hdir=[1, 1, 1], Unit='cgs')
    fit_mag = CrystalFieldFit(Model=cf, InputWorkspace=ws)
    fit_mag.fit()

    # Fits a magnetisation vs temperature dataset. Data is in Am^2/mol, measured with a 0.1T field || [110]
    cf.PhysicalProperty = PhysicalProperties('M(T)', Hmag=0.1, Hdir=[1, 1, 0], Unit='SI')
    fit_moment = CrystalFieldFit(Model=cf, InputWorkspace=ws)
    fit_moment.fit()

Unfortunately only 1D datasets can be fitted (e.g. M(H, T) cannot be fitted as a simultaneous function of field and
temperature).

Simultaneous Fitting of Physical Properties and Inelastic Neutron Spectra
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, physical properties data and neutron spectra may be fitted simultaneously. In this case, all the inelastic
neutron spectra must be specified first in the list of input workspaces, with the physical properties dataset(s)
following in the same order as specified in the `PhysicalProperty` attribute, which for multiple physical
properties should be a list. E.g.::

    # Fits an INS spectrum (at 10K) and the heat capacity simultaneously
    cf = CrystalField('Ce', 'C2v', B20=0.37737, B22=3.9770, B40=-0.031787, B42=-0.11611, B44=-0.12544)
    cf.Temperature = 10
    cf.FWHM = 1.5
    cf.PhysicalProperty = PhysicalProperties('Cv')
    fit = CrystalFieldFit(Model=cf, InputWorkspace=[ws_ins_10K, ws_cp])
    fit.fit()

    # Fits two INS spectra (at 44K and 50K) and the heat capacity, susceptibility and magnetisation simultaneously.
    PPCv = PhysicalProperty('Cv')
    PPchi = PhysicalProperty('susc', 'powder', Unit='cgs')
    PPMag = PhysicalProperty('M(H)', 5, [1, 1, 1], 'bohr')
    cf = CrystalField('Ce', 'C2v', B20=0.37737, B22=3.9770, B40=-0.031787, B42=-0.11611, B44=-0.12544,
                      Temperature=[44.0, 50], FWHM=[1.1, 0.9], PhysicalProperty=[PPCv, PPchi, PPMag] )
    fit = CrystalFieldFit(Model=cf, InputWorkspace=[ws_ins_44K, ws_ins_50K, ws_cp, ws_chi, ws_mag])
    fit.fit()

Note that `PhysicalProperty` requires the type of physical property (either `'Cv'` or `'Cp'` or `'heatcap'` for
heat capacity; `'susc'` or `'chi'` for susceptibility; `'mag'` or `'M(H)'` for magnetic moment vs applied field;
or `'mom'` or `'M(T)'` for moment vs temperature) as the first argument. subsequent arguments are optional, and
are in the following order::

    PhysicalProperties('Cp')  # No further parameters required for heat capacity
    PhysicalProperties('chi', hdir, inverse, unit)
    PhysicalProperties('chi', unit)
    PhysicalProperties('mag', hdir, temp, unit)
    PhysicalProperties('mag', unit)
    PhysicalProperties('M(T)', hmag, hdir, inverse, unit)
    PhysicalProperties('M(T)', unit)

Or these parameters may be specified using keyword arguments, with the keywords: `'Hdir'`, `'Hmag'`, `'Inverse'`, 
`'Unit'`, and `'Temperature'` (note these are case sensitive, and not all parameters apply to all types of 
physical properties). The default values (`Hdir=[0,0,1]`, `Hmag=1`, `Inverse=False`, `Unit='cgs'` and 
`Temperature=1` are used if nothing is specified for a particular attribute.
