==============================
ISIS Powder Diffraction Script
==============================

Description
-----------
A wide variety of algorithms are available within Mantid for processing of data,
writing results files, etc.  These may be run interactively, one at a time, but
in general scripting (using the Python scripting language) enables a series of
algorithms to be called in a specific order to carry out more complex tasks, such
as data normalisation and writing data files suitable for input to Rietveld
refinement programmes (GSAS, FullProf, etc).

All the script files used to process GEM, HRPD, INS and Polaris data have been
integrated to Mantid which can be found inside the following directory on a Windows
machine: `C:\MantidInstall\scripts\PowderISIS`.

Run Requirement
---------------
There are a preference file and a small script which is required to run inside
`Scripting Window <http://docs.mantidproject.org/nightly/interfaces/
ScriptingWindow.html>`_ on mantid in order to carry out the data normalisation:

The preference file, a file with an extension name of .pref (e.g: UserPrefFile.pref)
will contain the following at least:

- vanadium, background and empty sample container (if used) run numbers
- parameters  for carrying out a sample absorption correction (if required)
- directories which can be assigned to RAW files, Vanadium Directory

*These directories have been left blank but can be changed and set by each user*
*on their preference. The directories are also modifiable via small script which*
*is ran inside* `Scripting Window <http://docs.mantidproject.org/nightly/interfaces
/ScriptingWindow.html>`_

The script which is required to be written inside `Scripting Window <http://docs.
mantidproject.org/nightly/interfaces/ScriptingWindow.html>`_ on Mantid contains:

- details of the location for all the files which will be utilised
- name of the pref file and folders
- the run number(s) you wish to process

Vanadium & Background Files
---------------------------

The vanadium and background files are smoothed (a spline wih 150 points works well
with Polaris data), and the vanadium Bragg reflections removed. The high and low
d-spacing limits of the observed V reflections in each of the detector banks are stored
in a file called VanaPeaks.dat - which is stored inside `Polaris` folder in
:ref:`post-structure-PowderISIS-ref`.

Both the smoothed and unsmoothed aligned and grouped vanadium data sets are written to
the `Polaris/test/Cycle_15_2/Calibration` folder.  These may be read in to a workspace
and compared against one another to ensure that the smoothing and peak stripping is
satisfactory (the smoothing function and number of 'fixed' points may be chosen to suit
the data).

Files & Folders
---------------

Files & Folder Pre-Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When `ExistingV` is `yes` inside the pref file that is being utilised, you are required
to have nexus files named after the value of `CorrVanFile` which is also found inside
the pref file. Within the image below we are using Polaris instrument so we shall need 5 nexus
files as you can see inside the calibration folder (5 is the number of banks
for Polaris). If the nexus files are not found, then the script will automatically change
`ExvistingV` to `no` from `yes` until the end of the process.

.. _post-structure-PowderISIS-ref:

Files & Folder Post-Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Once the process has completed, files should be generated inside the `Calibration`
and `Mantid_tester` folder.

.. image:: /images/PowderISIS_Post_structure_extV_yes.PNG

Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The structure of the folder shown above in the image can be easily modified within
the script that is written inside `Scripting Window <http://docs.mantidproject.org/nightly/
interfaces/ScriptingWindow.html>`_. The script that is being used to generate above
folder structure can be found in the :ref:`usage-PowderISIS-ref` section.
If the `Analysisdir` equals empty string ("") or `Analysisdir` is not pass as a parameter
within the python script, the `GrpOff` and `Cycle_15_2` folder will be required inside the
`Polaris` folder.

Similarly if the `Cycle_15_2` or `user` is passed as an empty string ("") or else is not passed
as a parameter, then the script shall look for the files in previous folder.

Data Layout
-----------

The 'GrpOff' folder is always required, within the 'GrpOff' folder is a .cal file
which gives the detector grouping (i.e. the detector banks' numbers) and the Offset
to be applied to focus each detector (this is in addition to the "ideal" instrument
geometry focusing information, which Mantid determines from the Instrument
Definition File).

The run number, vanadium number and V-Empty number data is required to be provided
within the raw directory, if the vana-peaks are also required to be removed then a
file named `VanaPeaks.dat` is needed inside the raw directory.
This will enable vana peaks to be removed by interpolation in range given within
the `VanaPeaks.dat` file. The vanadium number and V-Empty number is set in the pref file
as shown below, the script shall look for the raw files (with the format of
<instrument><run-number>, e.g: POL78338 and POL78339) inside the raw directory.

.. code-block:: python

   #----------------------------------------------------
   # Runs Numbers
   #----------------------------------------------------
   #
   Vanadium     78338
   V-Empty      78339
   S-Empty      0
   #

Output
^^^^^^

The output files will vary on the values provided in pref file for the following
variables, which either equal yes or no.

.. code-block:: python

   #Output
   XYE-TOF      yes
   XYE-D        yes
   GSS          yes
   Nexus        yes

The `XYE-TOF`, `XYE-D`, `GSS` and `Nexus` files along with a copy of the `Grouping` file
are all generated where the pref file is located, which would be inside the
'Mantid_tester' folder in :ref:`post-structure-PowderISIS-ref`.

The `Calibration` folder (which is created automatically), where that cycle's smoothed
and corrected vanadium files are stored (note - there is not a multiple scattering
correction available yet for the vanadium).  If a file name is not specified in the
.pref file for the smoothed vanadium files, a file name is generated automatically,
which contains both the vanadium and the background run numbers.

Default Directory
-----------------

With the mantid feature `Manage User Directories <http://www.mantidproject.org/
ManageUserDirectories>`_, users are able to reveal the instrument directory to mantid,
which can then be utilised inside the python script by simply calling DIRS[0], if the
following script is also passed in `Scripting Window <http://docs.mantidproject.org/
nightly/interfaces/ScriptingWindow.html>`_ (DIR[0]- 0 being the first/top directory listed
inside `Manage User Directories <http://www.mantidproject.org/ManageUserDirectories>`_).

.. code-block:: python

   from mantid import config
   DIRS = config['datasearch.directories'].split(';')

To get the directory inside the `Manage User Directories <http://www.mantidproject.org/
ManageUserDirectories>`_, just use `Browse To Directory` button the find the directory
of the instrument folder, once directory has been added, select the directory and move
it to the top of the list with the help of `Move Up` button on the right.

However depending on the preference of the user, a directory of the instrument can
directly be passed as a variable, for example:

.. code-block:: python

   dir = 'X:\'
   FilesDir = 'X:\Polaris'

   expt = cry_ini.Files('Polaris', RawDir=FilesDir, Analysisdir='test', forceRootDirFromScripts=False, inputInstDir=dir)

User may also place the instrument folder where the script is located, which would be
found in the following directory on Windows platform `C:\MantidInstall\scripts\PowderISIS\ `.
Using instrument folder from where the scripts are located can simply be done by
modifying the following line of the :ref:`usage-PowderISIS-ref` script to:

.. code-block:: python

   expt = cry_ini.Files('Polaris', RawDir=(DIRS[0] + "Polaris"), Analysisdir='test', forceRootDirFromScripts=True)

Additional Information
----------------------

Files & Folder Pre-Structure With No ExistingV
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Image below displays the only files required when `ExistingV` is `no` inside the
pref file. This means that the `Calibration` folder, where that cycle's smoothed
and corrected vanadium files are stored will not be required for this process.
Instead the files will be generated and the script will automatically change the
pref file value of `ExistingV` to `yes` from `no` once the process has finished.

.. image:: /images/PowderISIS_pre_structure.png

Files & Folder Post-Structure With No ExistingV
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Once the process has completed, additional files with the label `unstripped` should
be generated inside the calibration folder, if `ExistingV` is `no`.
